Hello this is a small project inspired by geiiker tic tac toe written in javascript.

Below is a summy of the js codes and how they function:

gameContainer: The HTML element that holds the game grid.
statusText: The HTML element that displays the current game status.
currentPlayer: Tracks the current player, starting with 'X'.
board: An object to store the current state of the board, with keys as coordinates and values as player marks.
playerMarks: An object to keep track of the positions of the marks for each player.
gameOver: A boolean flag to indicate if the game is over.

createBoard(size): This function initializes the game grid.
- It sets up the grid columns based on the size parameter.
- It creates individual cells, assigns them coordinates (data-x and data-y), and attaches a click event listener to each cell.
- Cells are added to the gameContainer.

resetGame(): This function resets the game to its initial state.
It clears the board and playerMarks objects, sets currentPlayer to 'X', and gameOver to false.
Updates the status text to indicate the current player's turn.
Clears the gameContainer and recreates the board with the initial size of 3 by 3

placeMark(x, y): This function handles placing a mark on the board.
It returns early if the game is over or if the cell is already occupied.
If the current player already has 3 marks, the oldest mark is removed from the board and the corresponding cell is cleared.
Updates the cell content and the board state with the current player's mark.
Checks for a win using checkWin(x, y). If the current player wins, it updates the status text to display the winner and shows a "Play Again" button.
If no win is detected, it switches to the other player and updates the status text.

checkWin(x, y): This function checks if the current player has won the game.
It defines the possible winning directions (horizontal, vertical, and two diagonals).
For each direction, it counts consecutive marks of the current player.
If three consecutive marks are found in any direction, it returns true, indicating a win.
If no win is detected, it returns false.

handleClick(event): This function is called when a cell is clicked.
It extracts the x and y coordinates from the clicked cell and calls placeMark(x, y) to handle the placement of the mark.


createBoard(3): Initializes the game board with a size of 3x3 when the script is first loaded.
This code sets up an infinite Tic Tac Toe game where each player can place up to three marks on a 3x3 grid. When a player wins, a "Play Again" button is displayed, allowing the game to be reset and started anew.
